This project is a starter for demonstrating how Redux Middleware works. It is initialized with redux, redux-react, and axios. Redux has a weather reducer that expects a weather object. fetchWeather is an action creator that will need to make an async request and return the action to the reducer. Trouble!!! ...without redux middleware :)
